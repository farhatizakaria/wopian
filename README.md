### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on:

- [Kitsu.io], a content discovery and tracking platform for anime and manga fans
- [kitsu], a framework agnostic [JSON:API] client implementation
- [Kitsu Season Trends], daily statistical trends of seasonal anime on [Kitsu.io]
- and many more open source projects!

🌱 I’m currently learning Crystal and Elixir

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source Vue projects

❤️ I'm looking for [sponsors] to keep my projects maintained and operational

📷 I'm a hobbyist photographer over at [wopian.moe]
